# FastCredit: AI-Powered On-Chain Credit Passports

FastCredit is a decentralized, AI-driven platform that empowers unbanked and gig workers to build a verifiable, evolving financial identity on the Bahamut blockchain.

---

## ‚ùó Problem Statement
- **1.4 Billion Unbanked Adults Globally:** According to the World Bank, 1.4 billion adults lack access to essential financial services.
- **Gig Workers Face Credit Challenges:** Nearly half of gig workers are denied financial services due to traditional credit scoring that ignores their income patterns.
- **"Credit Invisible" Individuals:** Many are excluded from the financial system because they lack a formal credit history, making it hard to prove creditworthiness.

## üõ†Ô∏è Smart Contract Architecture

### FastCredit.sol
- ERC-721 NFT contract representing a user's financial identity and rank (BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD, PLATINUM, DIAMOND).
- Stores stake amount, verified income, and allows for dynamic upgrades via AI verification.
- Only authorized contracts can mint or update passports.

### PassportStaking.sol
- Users stake FTN to mint their Credit Passport NFT.
- Rank is determined by the amount staked (with thresholds for each rank).
- Allows multiple stakes per user for demo flexibility.
- Enforces a lock period before unstaking.

### AIVerifier.sol
- Handles verification of user income data through an oracle pattern.
- Integrates with backend AI (Gemini) to verify documents and update NFT rank.
- Rank can be upgraded based on verified income, never downgraded.

---

## üåê Technology Stack
- **Blockchain:** Bahamut (Testnet)
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity, Hardhat, OpenZeppelin
- **AI:** Google Gemini API
- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, Privy, Ethers.js
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express (for AI verification, if running locally)

   - User uploads income documents (file/camera).
   - Gemini AI verifies docs and suggests a new rank.
   - UI: `/start/verify`.
3. **Stake Again (Uncapped):**
   - User is prompted to stake 0.4 FTN (or more) to unlock DIAMOND rank.
   - UI: `/start/stake2`.
4. **Mint NFT:**
